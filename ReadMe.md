Brief:


Build an app which allows a pub landlord to run a pub quiz.

The quiz attendees will not need to see the app. Only the landlord and/or the quiz-master.




MVP:


The questions archive should contain a series of questions which have:
- Question
- Correct Answer
- Incorrect Answers (there should be 3 so that each question is a multiple choice question with 4 choices).
- A difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)
- A Topic (history, geography, literature, et cetera)



The landlord should be able to:

1 - Add new questions and answers to the archive.

2 - Read questions from the archive.

3 - Update a question (e.g. change it to make it easier or harder)

4 - Update the answers to existing questions if needed (eg, if world records are broken or if there is a new champion of a sport)

5 - Change the difficulty level of the question or the question topic.

6 - Add new topics under which questions might be categorised.

7 - Remove questions, answers or topics from the archive.

8 - Create individual quizzes. Any questions added to an individual quiz should be added to the main archive.



Extensions:


1 - Filter the question list by topic or by difficulty

2 - Allow questions to have more than one topic.

3 - Generate a random quiz of N questions from the question archive.



Advanced Extensions:

1 - Highlight if the question has been used already in a  quiz, if so, when this was and/or how many quizzes the question has been used in.

2 - Add selectable filters for exclusion of questions which have already been used in a prior quiz when generating a quiz or to only include questions on a given topic.

3 - Allow True/False questions to be added to the database as their own question type with parallel functionality to the 4x multiple choice questions.
